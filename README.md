# DeepFake-Recognition
This is a DeepFake Recognition model that is developed and deployed using PyTorch and Gradio.
This model gives 99.91% test accuracy.
The model is trained over 20351 deepfake images and 13233 real images of people.
Datasets used are : FaceForensics (for DeepFake images) & LFW - People (Face Recognition) (for real face images). 
Combined both datasets to train & test the model over 33584 images
Model used is ViT(Vision Transformer).
